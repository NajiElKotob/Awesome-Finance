* [Gross Margin Definition](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-gross-margin-dollars-percentage-revenue-24412.html) In business accounting, gross margin dollars represent the total profit generated by the sale of a product or service. In his online report 3 Keys to Profitability, writer and certified public accountant Stan Snyder notes that gross margin dollars represent a product's markup. If a company purchases a product for $20 and sells it for $30, it generates $10 in gross margin dollars through its $10 markup. Gross margin dollars are usually a good starting point for determining the health of a business, but they do not take into consideration other expenses that take away from profits.
